# RF Device Monitoring and Interaction Scripts

## Overview

This project provides Bash scripts for monitoring and interacting with RF devices connected via USB. These scripts can be used to list connected RF devices, monitor real-time data, and communicate with the devices using serial commands.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- **RF Device**: USB RF transceiver or USB-to-serial adapter with an RF module.
- **USB-to-Serial Adapter**: Required if the RF device doesn't have a direct USB connection.

### Software

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, etc.)
- **Terminal Emulator**: `minicom` is required for serial communication.

### Permissions

- **User Permissions**: Add your user to the `dialout` group to access serial ports:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
  ```

## Installation

1. **Install Minicom**: 
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install minicom
   ```

2. **Clone or Download Scripts**: Save the scripts to your local machine.

3. **Make Scripts Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x rf_monitor.sh
   chmod +x rf_device_tool.sh
   ```

4. **Edit Script Variables**: Adjust `DEVICE_PORT` and `BAUD_RATE` in the scripts to match your device configuration:
   ```bash
   nano rf_monitor.sh
   ```
   ```bash
   DEVICE_PORT="/dev/ttyUSB0"  # Update with your device's port
   BAUD_RATE="115200"          # Update with your device's baud rate
   ```

## Usage

### List and Interact with RF Devices

Run the script to list USB devices and interact with an RF device:
```bash
./rf_device_tool.sh
```

### Monitor RF Device

Run the script to start monitoring an RF device:
```bash
./rf_monitor.sh
```

### Check Logs

View the logs for any output or errors:
```bash
cat /var/log/rf_monitor.log
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Device Connection**: Ensure the device is properly connected and recognized by the system using:
  ```bash
  lsusb
  dmesg | grep tty
  ```

- **Permissions**: Verify that your user is in the `dialout` group to access serial ports without `sudo`.

- **Baud Rate and Port**: Ensure the correct `DEVICE_PORT` and `BAUD_RATE` settings in the scripts.

### Notes

- **Configuration**: Update any necessary sections to reflect the actual configuration of your RF devices and system environment.

- **Project Structure**: If there are more scripts or specific directory structures involved, you may want to expand the `README` to include additional details. 

This `README` provides a clear and concise guide to setting up and using the RF scripts. Let me know if you need any further customizations or additions!
